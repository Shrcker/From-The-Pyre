# From the Pyre

A browser game about fuelling the Pyre, a bizarre idea that lead you into the darkest corners of the Forest. Will you find out why you had to run, or will the shadows swallow you whole?

A *very* work in progress text-based game inspired by A Dark Room and Cultist Simulator.

Otherwise just have fun with it! Currently there is no ending, or beginning for that matter, but one may come sooner than the other!

Since this project is early access, feedback and forking is encouraged.

## Credits

Much credit goes to my very good friend [Lico](https://github.com/s-lycopersicum) for helping me figure out a lot of the complexities of JavaScript I still haven't really drilled in yet. Project wouldn't have been possible if we weren't able to rubber-duck each other about it.
